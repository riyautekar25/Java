Topic -  LinkedHashSet
1. Duplicates are not allowed
2. insertion order preserved
3. HashTable and LinkedSet
4. whatever methods available in HashSet supported for the LInkedHashSet

Topic - Queue(I) : extends :=> 1. DQueue(I) 2. BlockingQueue(I) 3. BlockingDqueue(I)
		           implemented by:=> 1. Priority queue 2. Linked list

PriorityQueue properties:
1. first in first out
2. insertion order preserved
3. duplicates are allowed
4. Homogeneous data only allowed

Map Interface
1. Map(I) is not a child interface of collection, completely independent from collection
2. implemented by: 1. HashMap(C) 2. HashTable(C) 
3. map is always represented by key value pair
4. duplicate keys are not allowed but values can be duplicated

Properties of HashMap
1. implemented by HashTable data structure
2. insertion order not preserved
3. duplicate keys are not allowed but values can be duplicated
4. null key allowed only once (because key is always unique) but multiple null values allowed

Difference between HashMap and HashTable
HashMap: 1. Non Synchronized (Multiple threads allowed at a time)
2. not thread safe
3. performance faster 
4. null key allowed only one time, values multiple times 

HashTable: 1. Synchronized (one thread allowed at a time)
2. thread safe
3. performance poor
4. nulls can not be allowed
